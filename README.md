# Core Lightning plugin for sending zap events

You can add the plugin by copying it to CLN's plugin directory or by adding the following line to your config file:

```
plugin=/path/to/cln-zapper
```

This plugin only handles the zap note. You will also need an lnurl server to create invoice like https://github.com/elsirion/clnurl. I would recommend setting that up first.

This guide can be followed for more details on how to set up: https://github.com/TheFockinFury/Non-Custodial-Nostr-Zaps-CLN


## Options
`cln-zapper` exposes the following config options that can be included in CLN's config file or as command line flags:
* `clnzapper_nostr_nsec`: The nostr private key used to sign zapper notes
* `clnzapper_nostr_relay`: The default nostr relay to publish to
* `clnzapper_pay_index_path`: path to save most recent pay index. Defaults to `datadir`.
